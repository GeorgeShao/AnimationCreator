# AnimationCreator
Simple animation tool that creates a video animation from user-drawn images.

Linked below is a short example animation that I made entirely using AnimationCreator. In this animation, a meteor falls from the sky and lands in the ocean. An alien then gets out of the meteorite and explodes, and the world ends.

## How to Use
1. Run the AnimationCreator.py file
2. Use the buttons on the left toolbar to select colours and shapes/lines to draw with
3. Use the buttons on the right toolbar to manage the frames/scenes
4. When done drawing a frame, click the "CAPTURE" button at the top right of the screen to capture the frame and prepare it for rendering
5. When done creating the entire animation, click the "RENDER" button at the top left of the screen to render the video animation

## Definitions/Terms
**Frame:** Every different drawing is a frame. You can create new frames, delete frames, clear frames, and go back and forth between viewing different frames by pressing the buttons on the right toolbar.

**Scene:** Scenes are like backgrounds. They make it easy to draw multiple similar frames without redrawing the entire frame every single time. You can create a scene by drawing it on a frame then click the "NEW SCN" button. To draw a scene that you have already created onto another frame, press the "LOAD SCN" button.
